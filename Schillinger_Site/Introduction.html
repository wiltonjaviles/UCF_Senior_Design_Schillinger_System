<p>The Schillinger System offers more possibilities for development, as opposed to existing rules that are limiting. Music theory tends to be lacking in terms of creativity. The majority of musical theory is biased and filled with misinterpretations of theories; this evolves into rules that are imposed on students of later generations as rules to follow. Theory writers were not scientists, and scientists did not write musical theory; Joseph Schillinger is the sole scientist who wrote musical theory. He synthesized mathematical logic and theory studies to provide a new approach towards musical composition. The Schillinger System provides possibilities, not limitations like traditional musical theory, while being applicable to all styles of music. He has been criticized for reducing composition to mathematics and for lacking creativity and subjective views.
