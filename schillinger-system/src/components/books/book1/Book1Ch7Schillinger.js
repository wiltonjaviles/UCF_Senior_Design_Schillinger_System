          CHAPTER 7. RESULTANIS APPLIED T0 INSTRUMENTAL FORMS.
          WHEN WE speak of time rhythm, we are referring to the periodicity of attacks, that is, the intervals of time at which the attacks occur.
          A. INSTRUMENTAL RHYTHM

          Instrumental rhythm is made up of the number of places of attack; for example, in beating two differently pitched kettle drums in sequence, we are dealing with two places of attack.
          Synchronizations of these two types of rhythm i.e, time rhythm and instrumental rhythmflare subject to the same laws of synchronization and interference as the time periodicity previously discussed.
          When the number of places in an instrumental group does not coincide with the number of terms in a time group, then a common denominator will define the number of time groups—and the number of instrumental groups— until their recurrence. For example, if we use two differently tuned kettle drums on r3÷ 2, the entire figure will close after the first group is over because the number of places in the instrumental group is two (kettle drums) and the number of terms in the time group is four (4÷2 = 2). This means that while the instrumental group appears twice, the rhythmic resultant will appear once.
          R3÷2
          Taking the same case of the two kettle drums for r 3÷ 2, we get a totally different resultant. The number of attacks in the instrumental group remains the same (2). The number of terms in the rhythmic resultant is 7, (2 + 1 + 1 + 1+1 + 1+ 2). 7X 2 = 14. Seven has a complementary factor 2, and 2 has a complementary factor 7. The kettle drum 2 attack figure will appear 7 times, while the rhythmic resultant appears twice.
          Here we see the first of what will come to be a great many examples of the way in which Schillinger’s theory of rhythm goes much further than the simple question of time rhythm. Note that Schillinger here states that instrumental rhythm is one thing (that is, the pattern according to which instruments enter or drop out of the ensemble) and time rhythm is another (that is, the pattern according to which the sounds are produced, regardless of which instruments are producing these sounds). Schillinger here discusses the application of his theory not only to the rhythm of the sounds produced, but also to the allocation of parts among various instruments.
          This principle may be carried out to any desired degree of complexity, depending on the common denominator between the number of terms in a rhythmic group and the number of attacks in an instrumental group. The difference between two kettle drums and any melody or any instrumental form of harmony (accompaniment) with respect to this calculation is merely a quantitative difference.
          Let us take a motif consisting of four different pitches, (for example: c, d, e, f); such sequence of pitches is merely one of the possible forms of melody. But superimposing r3÷2 we obtain one group without recurrence because the number of pitches (intonation attacks), and the number of terms in the rhythmic resultant (time attacks), are equal (4÷ 4=1). Taking the same four notes of the melody and superimposing r3÷2 we get 7X4=28. The rhythmic group having 7 attacks acquires the complementary factor 4, Le, it will run 4times until its own recurrence, while the melody having 4 attacks will acquire the complementary factor 7, i.e., it will run 7 times until its own recurrence will coincide with the recurrence of the rhythmic resultant.
          r3÷2
          This technique makes it possible to run a very simple motif practically to infinity, as the duration of continuous variability depends solely on a common denominator. A simple example of rhythmic continuity through instrumental interference may be found in many arrangements of fox-trots. The figure of 6 uniform attacks (two false triplets) placed in a common time measure (=8/8) produces an interference of 8÷6. 8÷6 reduces to 4÷3. Six acquires the complementary factor 4, and 8 acquires the complementary factor 3, i.e., the instrumental figure with 6 attacks runs 4 times in the course of 3 8 8 measures.
          The principles of rhythmic (time) and instrumental interference have been known since time immemorial. They constitute one of the most striking characteristics in the composition of rhythmic continuity as it exists in the music of the Orient as well as through the entire African continent. This tendency is almost as fundamental as the superimposition of a major generator on any uniform group—as for example, the imaginary grouping of the attacks of a ticking clock by 2, 3, 4, or any other simple number we can think of.
          B. APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERFERENCE TO HARMONY

          The principles of interference of rhythmic and instrumental groups, when applied to harmony, produce the most effective forms of accompaniment. They make it possible, as well, to correlate a number of accompaniments simultaneously.
          At this point, the illustrations of harmony are restricted to three of the simplest instrumental forms. However, in the later part of the- course, details of the instrumental forms of harmony will be discussed. Here we will cite:
          (1) The two~attack instrumental figure (as in the polka). The first attack is the detached bass of harmony. The second attack includes all the remaining upper parts of a Chord.
          (2) The four-attack instrumental figure (as in the fox-trot). The first attack is the lower bass. The second attack, the upper part of the chord. The third attack is another detached bass. The fourth attack, the upper part of a chord.
          (3) The six-attack instrumental figure (as in the rhumba). The first attack is the lower detached bass. The second attack is the upper part of the chord. The third attack is the middle-detached bass. The fourth attack is the upper part of the chord. The fifth attack is the upper detached bass. The sixth attack is the upper part of the chord.
          (1) (2) (3)
          It is easy to see that the waltz accompaniment figure is merely (1) above, with the upper chord having two attacks instead of one. The old tango and habanera figures are like (2), except that the last attack is made on the lower bass.
          The following diagrams illustrate the continuous run of these instrumental forms of harmony with various simpler rhythmic resultants, all used on one chord:
          3÷2
          One may also compose other instrumental forms of harmony with as many as 16 attacks—such as an alternation of the four different notes in the bass, with the upper part of the chord doubled in two octaves:
          16 attacks
          A still greater number of attacks in an instrumental figure may be produced by the common technique of arpeggio. Technically, any longer motif presents the same problem, except that its pitch commonly has a more limited range.
          When one time-group is distributed through the different places of attack, different individual parts become the resultant: of interference between the time and the instrumental groups. For example, if we have a figure of 4 places, as referred to in Item (2), page 29, and superimpose a time group, 2 +1 +1 (3 attacks), we obtain through the common denominator 12, 2 different instrumental resultants. One is the sequence of attacks on chords; the other, the sequence of attacks in the bass, when all the bass attacks are tied over. The upper part. produces the resultant 2 (2 + 3 + 3) and the bass, 2 (3 + 3 + 2). This is a striking example of transformation of one type of rhythm into another —a result of the phenomenon of instrumental and time interference.
          The 2 +1 +1 is a traditional classical figure, and, as expressed in the following musical example, consists of a quarter and two eighths. Yet the result sounds like a rhumba. This is due to the new resultant which appears as a sequence of the attacks of the bass notes.
          Four attacks 2+1+1 (three attacks)
          4x 3: 12 attacks
          2 (2+3+3)
          [Rhumba]
          2 (3 + 3+ 2)
          The preceding technical items may also be treated in combination. The following example represents the application of two generators and their resultants, combined with the instrumental interference. The accompaniment represents the minor generator (2). The sustained chords represent the major generator (5). The melody represents the resultant (5÷2). In addition, the whole score is carried out through an alien measure grouping, in While the entire
          rhythmic score would occupy 4 bars in 5 4 time, it takes 5 bars in 4 4 time. This example illustrates the possibility of introducing various rhythmic resultants into music which is supposed to be written in common time.
          The example in Figure 57 is of more than passing interest because it foreshadows the way in which full orchestral scores unprecedented richness and complexity are developed logically and organically from the rhythmic raw materials now being discussed  in this section.
