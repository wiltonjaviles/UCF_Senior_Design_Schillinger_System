          CHAPTER 9
          HOMOGENEOUS SIMULTANEITY
          AND CONTINUITY (VARIATIONS)
          The PRECEDING discussions show us that all rhythmic groups or rhythmic patterns are necessarily either the resultants of interferences or portions of such resultants.
          A figure such as 2 +1 +1 may be conceived as one of the elementary rhythmic patterns in 4 4 time. Yet it is possible, with this method of analysis, to assign it directly to a definite place in a definite resultant, the second bar of The longer patterns, such as the resultants produced by higher number-values or by more than two generators, possess enough variation in themselves.
          Musical memory does not emphasize a group of 20 or more- bars as one indivisible pattern. Therefore, the recurrence of such pattern seems to be less monotonous than the recurrence of a short pattern. Short patterns obviously call for variations.
          There are many outstanding compositions in which direct recurrence of a short pattern is used throughout the entire composition. for example, the first movement of Beethoven’s symphony No. 5; Chopin’s waltz No. 7, the second theme. In such compositions, rhythmic monotony is usually compensated for by the variety of devices used on some other components, it may be the dynamic, the harmonic, or the melodic composition of a piece that makes this music sound interesting. The best method by which to detect the effect of the purely rhythmic patterns is to isolate them from all other components, i.e., to take a fragment of a composition, Or the entire composition, and to perform the rhythm of it in a percussive manner.
          The musical components of rhythm include durations, rests, accents, split-unit groups and groups in general. The inherent variability of any of these components of the time rhythm depends solely on their quantitative form, i.e., whether there are two or three, or more, elements involved in the pattern subjected to variations—— for example, two elements, two durations, two forms of accent, as well as binary combinations of rests with durations, or durations with accents. The variability of groups follows the general principles of permutations.

          ae. GENERAL AND CIRCULAR PERMUTATIONS
          There are two fundamental forms of permutations: first, general permutations; second, circular permutations (displacement). The quantity of general permutations is the product of all integers from unity up to the number expressing the quantity of the elements in a group. For example, the general number of permutations produced by 5 elements equals the product of 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 5, i.e., 120. The number of circular permutations equals the number of elements in a group. Thus, five elements produce five circular permutations.
          When an extremely large amount of material is used, general permutations become very practical. But in cases where limitations are imposed by a certain type of esthetic necessity, circular permutations may solve the problem better than a vague selection from the entire number of general permutations.
          In the following exposition, a bi-coordinate method will be applied to the composition of continuity. A linear sequence of the modified versions of one pattern produces the time coordinate (continuity). A correlation of the modified patterns produces the coordinate of simultaneity (or pitch). In other words, all modified forms of the original pattern may grow through the bi-Coordinate system, i.e., they appear one after another in different parts, thus producing compensatory balance.
          In terms of music the above simply means that a score may be evolved with a continuous variation of the original pattern following through the different parts.
          Variations
          2 Elements
          Table of Permutations:
          2 permutations
          Examples of application:
          (1) Durations: Binomial 
          (2) Rests: [indicated with a circle around the number]:
          Binomial 
          Combined variations of durations and rests:
          (3) Accents [through superimposition of an additional component]:
          Binomial 1 + 1
          Binomial 5 + 3
          The additional component may emphasize the entire duration of the accented attack, as in the previous example, or be considerably shorter (just to single out the moment of attack).
          Example:
          Binomial 2 + 1
          Variations of rests may be combined with variations of the previous components.
          (4) Split-unit groups
          When durations are non-uniform, either value may be split in a binomial. 
          (5) Groups in General
          Any rhythmic group may become an element and be permuted with its converse.
          Song: Pennies from Heaven
          Schillinger's study of musical styles and the development of music took him from the earliest forms of recorded sound to contemporary popular American song. With an unusual catholicity of interest. Schillinger chooses illustrative materials frequently from popular songs. Copyright 1963 by Santly-Joy, Inc., New York, U.S.A. Reprinted by permission of the publishers.
          As can be easily observed from these examples, the converse variation-group produces a rhythmic counterpart.
          3 Elements
          Table of General Permutations:
          6 permutations
          Table of Circular Permutations:
          (ae) Clockwise circular permutations:
          3 permutations
          (b) Counter-clockwise circular permutations:
          3 permutations
          When two elements in a group of three are identical, circular permutations either in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction are the only possible ones.
          Examples of Application:
          (1) Durations:
          Trinomial 2+1+1;ae=2;b =1
          Using circular permutations of this continuity, we obtain the following simultaneity:
          (2) Rests:
          Trinomial
          (3) Accents:
          Trinomial
          Each group (with its additional component) of shifting accents may be used individually. Simultaneous application of all groups requires instruments of a different tone-quality for each group.
          (4) Split-Unit Groups:
          5) Groups in general:

          4 Elements
          Table of General Permutations:
          (1) All elements different.
          (2) Two elements identical.
          (3) Two pairs identical:
          (4) Three elements identical:
          Assuming that any of the permutations is an original group, each of the above groups may be limited to four circular permutations.
          Examples of application:
          (1) Durations:
          (a) All four elements different.
          Quadrinomial from r5÷4; 4 + 1 + 3 + 2
          ae=4; b=1;c=3;d=2
          This 24—group continuity produces a 24-part simultaneity in 24- bars of
          10 8 time.
          By limiting the original group (4+1+3 +2) to circular clockwise permutations, we obtain 4 parts in 24- bars of 10 8 time.
          (b) Two elements identical.
          Quadrinomial from r÷3; 3 + 1 + 2 + 2
          a = 2; b = 3; c = 1
          Form: b+c +ae+ae
          Starting with the third permutation of the corresponding table, we obtain:
          This 12-group continuity. produces a 12-part simultaneity in 12- bars of 8 8 time or in 24- bars of 4 4 time.
          (c) Two pairs identical.
          Quadrinomial +2; 2 + 1 + 1 + 2
          a = 2; b = 1
          Form: ae + b +b +ae
          Starting with the second permutation of the corresponding table, we obtain:
          This 6-group continuity produces a 6-part simultaneity in 6- bars of 6 8 time or in 12- bars of 3 4 time (1 = quarter note). Clockwise circular permutations give 4 parts in 4- bars of 6 8 time or 4 parts in 8- bars of 3 4 time (1 = quarter note)
          (d) Three elements identical.
          Quadrinomial: 3 +1 +1 +1
          ae=1; b =3
          Form: b + ae + ae + ae
          Starting with the fourth permutation of the corresponding table we obtain:
          This 4-group continuity produces a 4-part simultaneity in 4- bars of 6 8 time
          or in 8- bars of 3 4 time.
          Assigning different symbols to the same group we obtain the form ae +b+b+b.
          Then: (ae+b+b+b) + (b+ae+b+b) + (b+b+ae+b) + (b+b+b+ae)
          This produces a continuity of perfect musical quality:
          Similar modification of the symbols assigned is possible with any group
          containing identical terms.
          (2) Rests:
          Quadrinomial: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
          ae = circled 1 b = 1
          Analogous permutations of rests may be devised in non-uniform groups.
          (3) Accents:
          Quadrinomial: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
          Analogous permutations of accents may be devised in non-uniform groups.
          (4) Split-unit groups:
          Quadrinomial: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
          Analogous permutations may be devised in non-uniform groups originally consisting of four places.
          Example: r underlined 5 divided by 4= 4+ 1 +3 +2
          Either of the numbers may be split into a group:
          Any of these versions may be used. Each version contains 4 circular and 24 general permutations.
          (5) Groups in general:
          This group produces the following simultaneity and continuity:
          Simultaneity—4 parts.
          Continuity through circular permutations—16- bars.
          Continuity through general permutations—96- bars.
          The original 4- bars take the appearance of the example in (4) [split-unit groups]
          Any rhythmic resultant placed in 4- bars may constitute such a group.
          For example:
          r4÷3 grouped by a in 4 4 time:
          The number of variations is the same as in the preceding group.
          A group consisting of 4 elements may be produced from any rhythmic resultant, providing a non-uniform, distribution is applied:
          For example: r5÷3 grouped by b in 3 4 time:
          Example from the popular song. Pennies from Heaven. When necessary, a tie between the notes may be omitted, though it is not necessary if the same group repeats itself.
          You can see what extraordinary variety may be secured by a group as simple as this through this variation method.
          As the general velocity of musical time (tempo) is most essential in establishing one or another characteristic, many of the preceding examples, although similar in numbers, produce musical continuities as remote from each other in character as Handel is remote from the Cuban rhumba.
          For example, the group: ((circled 1) +1+1+1) + (1 + (circled 1) +1+1) + (1+1+ (circled 1) +1) +
          (1 +1+1+(circled 1)) being written and performed as largo in 4/4 time.

          The tables are worked out in detail on these and other pages not only for the sake of clarity; it is also a way of furnishing the practical composer with ready-made calculations so that each pattern need not be re-calculated whenever it is needed in actual composition. The time-saving way is to refer to the tables in this book, although a composer should also know how to calculate them afresh for himself, if necessary.
