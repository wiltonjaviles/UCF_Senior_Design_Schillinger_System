        CHAPTER 2

INTERFERENCES OF PERIODICITIES

We are now concerned with what may technically be called the generation of resultant rhythmic groups as produced by the interference of two synchronized monomial periodicities that is to say, the way in which one monomial periodicity (say, 3, 3, 3, 3) may be combined with another (say, 4, 4,4,4) so as to produce still another rhythm.

A periodicity consisting of greater number values will be denoted by the term, ‘major generator’ the smaller of the two will be called,‘ minor generator’ The way in which we will express two synchronized generators producing one interference-group is a÷b.* The expression for the resultant of interference
is ra÷b.

A. BINARY SYNCHRONIZATION

To synchronize two monomial periodicities it is necessary:
(1) to ﬁnd common product or common denominator (c.p. or Cd.)

(2) to ﬁnd complementary factors of both generators; the complementary
factor of a is ab/a = b, and the complementary factor of b is ab/b = a.

After this is completed, it is necessary to draw a graph of both generators in their synchronization. To ﬁnd the resultant (r), drop perpendiculars from all points of attack on both generators. The resultant is discovered by drawing lines through these points. The common product is then added to the diagram, and the number-values of the resultant are indicated. The entire diagram is then translated into musical notation.

When a equals any number-value, and b equals one, the resultant expresses a musical bar, whether or not this bar—line would actually be drawn on music paper. Thus, a formula for a musical bar (or measure) is: '

T = ra÷1
(read: musical bar(T) is the resultant of a to one.)

First Case,
2 ÷ 1
Find the resultant, r2÷1
Common product (c.p.) 2x1 = 2
Complementary factor of a 2/2=1 1(2)
Complementary factor of b 2/2=2 2(1/2)
a consists of two’s
b consists of one’s

*Although Schillinger here and elsewhere uses the division sign to indicate the a and b division  relationship (a÷b), it should be noted that Schillinger on other occasions uses a colon in place of the division sign (a÷ :.b).

Neither the colon nor the division sign is employed as in ordinary arithmetic. 4:3 means in ordinary arithmetic, 4 divided by 3 or 4/3 and 4 ÷ by 3 means the same. In Schillinger’s use of these signs, neither a ratio nor division is meant. He meant interference by them, the full mathematical formula for which is a:b=b+(a-b)+(2a-2b)+(2a-2b)+(2a-2b)+(a-b)+b…. In arithmetic 4:3 In Schillinger 4:3 

Here is the operation expressed in numbers, in graph, and in musical notation:



Figure 6'.

The resultant differs from b with respect to accent (which results from the coincidence of attacks of both generators).

Musically, the ﬁrst case establishes a bar in which the musical numerator is 2, i.e., 2/2(¢), 2/4, 2/8. When the bar is 2/2, 1/2= ;when the bar is 2/4, 1/2= when the bar is 2/8, 1/2 = 

Second Case
3÷ 1
Find the resultant, r3÷ 1
3 x1 = 3
1 (3)
3 (I)



Figure 7.

In this case, using a and b we hear the resultant, i.e., three uniform durations, with the accent on the ﬁrst, This produces all bars with musical numerator three, i. E. 3/2,3/4,3/8.



Figure 8.

Third Case

4÷ 1

Find the resultant, r4÷ 1
4x1
1 (4)
4 (1)

ﬁgure .9.

The importance of this procedure lies in the fact that even the most noted composers of today do not seem to know that to eXpress a bar before a non-uniform group is offered is to represent the scheme of uniformity with respect to the periodicity of accents. This means that an accent should not be forced but should result from superimposition of a on b.

When it comes to the application of higher numerators~ such as 5, 7, or 11~ the entire music becomes incomprehensible to the average listener, and the composer is the one to blame. When it comes to the shifting of accents which are not correctly expressed (i.e., through the use of a and b), the performance is never adequate; the performer suffers (for example, hear Stokowski in Stravinsky’s Rites of Spring), and the listener wonders what it is all about.

Non-uniform rhythmic resultants occur when b 1. Through the procedure described above, one may obtain all the rhythmic patterns of the past, present and future, including all the possible rhythms of the Orient or of the primitives.

B. GROUPING

Three forms of grouping are available.*
(1) Grouping by C.p. In this case, c.p.= 6, which may express musical
quarters or eighths.



Figure 11

Six may also express six units in 13- or 7} time, then:


Figure 12.

*The technique and theory of grouping are described in detail in Chapter 3. (Ed)

(2) Superimposition Of a. a= 3. In order to get the reality of such superimposition, op. must be excluded and b becomes merely an optional



Figure 13.

(3) Superimposition of b. b= 2; c.p. is excluded: 21 becomes optional.

All these diagrams represent the natural nucleus of a musical score,* in which c.d. units are arpeggio or obligato ﬁgures, a and b are chords, ,r rhythms of the theme, and c.p. sustained  tones (pedal point). The resultants have the following characteristics:

*It may be useful to stress the fact that Schillinger means just what he says in this sentence (and other sentences);  that is he means not only that these patterns could be the prototype of a musical score but as he will show much later they are actually the bases of scoring. (Ed.)

(1) recurrence
(2) balance (in n+3: 2 + 2)
(3) contrasts (in r4.;_3: 3 + I)
(4)inversion, through the axis of symmetry (center):


Thus, esthetic efﬁciency (harmony of form) is a product of physical efﬁciency.

All rhythmic patterns in music are either complete or incomplete resultants.

Take, for example, a ﬁgure a/4 ;it is r3÷ 2. Take C  ;it is two-thirds of the r4÷ 3.

When all the resultants up to a = 9 have been found, one can obtain all the patterns of the past and present, and, to some extent, of the future.

In making your own diagrams, make them on graph paper, eliminating the c.d. units; they are the units of the cross sections.*

All the necessary generators for practical purposes are :**



Figural 19.

When c.p. is greater than 15, use a and b superimposition only.

When the numbers get large, a musical eighth () becomes the most practical musical denominator. All the reducible fractions are excluded from the above chart, for they give recurrences of the previous cases. For example, 6÷ 4 would simply give 3÷ 2 twice.

The a and b components present a clear idea of how cross-rhythms should be performed. Beating a and b with both hands, listen to the resultant, i.e., playing 3 against 2,play one—two, one, one, one-two (2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = ),
alternating hands.

*In the foregoing, Schillinger has given an extremely rigorous (as the logicians say) statement of the case so as to satisfy the most exacting demands of mathematicians and other scientists. It may be helpful to state the process in another, and less rigorous, way for the benefit of 'those who are not directly interested in the scientiﬁc aspects of the matter. The process is this: (1) take a. Piece of graph paper, and regard each square from left to right as some unit in time, whether it be a sixteenth note, an eighth note, or what not; (2) mark off the larger of the two generators in a fashion similar to that seen in Figure 10 or Figure 47, that is, breaking the line—if the major generator be 4-every four units;  (3) then mark of? the smaller generator until
the two come out even; (4) then mark off the resultant, by making a line which breaks wherever either (or both) of the other two lines breaks. This can be done very rapidly, and the process is best learned by actually carrying it out. Schillinger generally used graph paper with twelve squares to the inch. ( Ed.)

When Schillinger presents a list of this kind, it is his intention that the student should work out all of these instances for himself. He planned the present manuscript so as to have it serve the double function of a workbook and theoretical study. (Ed)

Let me add a few words on primitive rhythm: the true primitive rhythm (such as the rhythm used by some African cannibalistic tribes) is a combination of various monomial periodicities in time-continuity.

For example:
2 + 2 + . . .
3 + 3 + . . .
4 +4 + . . . etc.
These, when combined in sequence, produce such rhythmic patterns as:
(2+2)+1+(1+1+1)+(1+1+1+1)+ . . . =4/4
