        Introduction.
        Schillinger combined musical theory with recent findings in various scientific disciplines. He was the first to scientifically classify components of the musical system. Musical theory and science have been previously intertwined, dating back to Pythagoras, up to more modern musical theorists like Jean-Philippe Rameau and Helmholtz. Even so, mathematics and music has been a rare combination, considering the abstract nature of music and the strictness of mathematics. This cross has been a result of romanticism, thus being fairly recent in a historical context. One of Schillinger’s aims is to discover “general underlying principles” of the behavior of tonal phenomena. His contributions to theory, unlike his predecessors, is based on actual properties of music, and not deriving from previous theorists. Another one of Schillinger’s aims is to uncover and classify “all of the available resources of our tonal system”. The use of mathematics allows the task to be practical since it is of a great enough scope, unlike any other methodology.
        A third, and larger, goal is defined by Schillinger as a necessary corollary of the first two. “From the standpoint of science, analysis implies synthesis.” He is saying that the ability to break down a problem or structure into its main components implies the ability to reconstruct such things through synthesizing such elements. The argument is made that previous scientific approaches to musical theory were “partial in character”. It is said their generalizations were applicable to given aspects, not the art of composition as a whole.” Schillinger himself phrases his complete method as involving “the prefabrication and the assembly of components according to a preconceived design of the whole.”
        Tools and Concepts:
        The tools of analysis employed by Schillinger were employed by earlier musical theorists before he used them. For example, the graphing method, as used in daily stock reports, was nearly 300 years old at the time of use.
        Theory of Rhythm:
        “Viewed simply from the standpoint of problems of duration, meter, and accent, this theory provides the means for evolving all conceivable rhythms of past, present, and future…” The theory is based on interference as revealed in physics of wave motion. “Non-uniform durations may be produced by combining or causing interference between two uniform series of durations.”
        This can then be modified by using a duration of value 4 to interfere with durations of value 3. Example: Beat one series with one hand and the other with your other hand- listen to the result. [43,32, 21, etc]. There are a plethora combinations and permutations that can be applied to discover thousands of variant patterns. The process of producing rhythmic resultants is based on numbers and the resultants are a series of numbers. The number values of the two musical illustrations above are as follows: 3+1+2+2+1+3. As this moves from rhythm to other aspects the series, or patterns, become coefficients of recurrence which are then applied to pitch-units, pitch-scales, harmonic cycles, correlated melodies, densities, etc. When applied to scales, the coefficients of recurrence yield melodies; applied to two or more melodies, they produce counterpoint; applied to tonal cycles, they produce harmonic patterns; applied to harmonic patterns, they produce different styles, etc. Essentially, there are plenty of ways to apply these series, or patterns, to different facets of musical theory and composition in order to yield many different results.
        Patterns of Music and Nature
        Schillinger argues that his theory of rhythm, also called theory of regularity and coordination is the basis of all pattern-making in the universe. Before we, as humans, realized it, we were abstracting quantities, forms, and structures to repurpose them in order to excite sensations. Psychology tells us, through plenty of research, that similar configurations, in nature, through music, on a canvas, all excite similar sensations. “Schillinger became interested in discovering the basic patterns of growth, motion, and evolution in the universe.”  This is what his theory of regularity and coordination represents (Rhythm).
        In book 1, rhythm, it is shown that resultant patterns have a universality. These patterns repeat themselves. Schillingers studied the works of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, and other great musicians and found that they intuitively employ similar patterns that evoke emotion. They, perhaps without realizing, interpreted a mathematical logic of structure. They apply complex formations through their music, without any knowledge of the process involved, in order to “appeal to us as forms of beauty when expressed through the art medium.” 
        Aristotle, Einstein, and Geometry:
        Schillinger infers the Aristotelian idea that “Art imitates nature” by stating that great music and all great art reproduce laws of development of the universe. Schillinger aimed “to transform musical qualities into time-space structures, i.e., into the geometric relations of their components.” This was done via graphing.
        Example:
        Each horizontal square represents an eighth-note and each vertical square represents a semitone
        Schillinger proposes that musical motion, when projected into spatial configuration, possesses characteristics similar to motion, action, growth, or other eventual processes. “Music is capable of expressing everything which can be translated into a form of motion.”  This graph “vivifies one aspect of the relationship between music and motion.”
        The problems of musical components are presented by three general aspects:
        1. “Substitution of a scientific method of recording a musical composition for inadequate systems of notation;
        2. Modification of a musical work through variation of its geometric properties; and
        3. Production of music from a system of number values translated into geometric relations and thereafter into corresponding components of the tonal art.” 
        Schillinger's Masterful Pedagogy:
        A key aspect of Schillinger’s system is that only an elementary understanding of mathematics is required to begin learning. The system is well suited to incremental learning, and with copious examples provided it is typically easy to learn a wide range of theory with the Schillinger system. In addition, the system provided by Schillinger lends itself to illustrating more clearly a wider range of tonal systems than traditional musical notation.
        Using this system, Schillinger arrived at 9 fundamental ideas:
        1. That music is determined as a logical system in the Cartesian or Einsteinian manner
        2. The aesthetic qualities of music may be analyzed into the geometric relation of its components: rhythm, melody, harmony
        3. Variation may be achieved through modification of the inherent geometric relations.
        4. Music may be composed by taking a system of number values, transforming them into geometric relations, and thereafter into corresponding components of rhythm, melody, and harmony.
        5. Insight into music, as with any naturally occurring system, comes with the discovery of regularity and evolution as rhythm.
        6. Musical patterns are ultimately just a special case of pattern making.
        7. Schemes of pattern making originate in natural objects, and as natural objects yield various number series.
        8. These series and mathematical ratios excite the mind in the same way that visual patterns will.
        9. In conclusion, great works of art are derivative of mathematical logic, whether or not the creator is conscious of this. The esthetic harmony of great musical compositions may be discovered through mathematical analysis.
        Schillinger then summarized the history of art and music with the following basic ideas:
        1. Nature produces physical phenomena which reveal an esthetic harmony to us; this harmony is due to periodic and combinatorial processes; esthetic realities embody mathematical logic.
        2. Man recreates esthetic realities by reproducing the appearance of the physical realities through his own body or through a material at his command; this process involves mathematical logic regardless of whether the artist is conscious of it or not. Imitating nature in an artistic medium, the artist achieves the laws of mathematical logic through his sensuous experience. This is the intuitive period of art creation.
        3. Becoming more conscious in the course of his evolution, man begins to produce directly from the laws themselves. With the development of the technique of handling the materials of the art medium (special components) as well as rhythm of the composition as a whole (general components: space, time), man is enabled to select the desired product and the machine does the rest; this is the period of rational art creation. Thus the evolution of art falls into a closed system. An esthetic reality may be either a natural product, a product of human creative intuition, or a product of composition, realized through computation by mathematical logic.
        Schillinger expounds on these ideas in Mathematical Basis of the Arts.
        Achievements of the Schillinger System:
        The crowning achievement of the Schillinger system is that it is comprehensive enough to describe and explain any extant and any future system of music. It does so by achieving the following:
        1. Establishing general laws, true in any special instance.
        2. Offering techniques for composing variations comprehensively.
        3. Developing a rational theory of melody.
        4. Making music modernized or antiquated, as desired.
        5. Drawing together any rhythmic method from any period.
        6. Providing harmonization techniques that scale to up to 576 voices
        7. Evolving objective methods for musical analysis that lend themselves to systematic style changing.
        8. Making the process of composition more readily available without relying on natural ability.
        9. Simplifying the objective criticism of music.
        10. Establishing a falsifiable system for defining the relation between form, style, and the emotional appeal of music.
        11. Simplifying musical pedagogy.
        12. Accomplishing the above without inhibiting composition at more advanced levels.
        Conclusion: 
        Schillinger's system provides a scientific system for writing and analyzing music.
