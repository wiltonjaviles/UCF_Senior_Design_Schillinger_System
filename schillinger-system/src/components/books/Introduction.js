        Schillinger combined musical theory with recent findings in various 
        scientific disciplines. He was the first to scientifically classify 
        components of the musical system. Musical theory and science have been 
        previously intertwined, dating back to Pythagoras, up to more modern 
        musical theorists like Jean-Philippe Rameau and Helmholtz. Even so, 
        mathematics and music has been a rare combination, considering the 
        abstract nature of music and the strictness of mathematics. This cross 
        has been a result of romanticism, thus being fairly recent in a historical 
        context. One of Schillinger’s aims is to discover “general underlying 
        principles” of the behavior of tonal phenomena. His contributions to 
        theory, unlike his predecessors, is based on actual properties of music, 
        and not deriving from previous theorists. Another one of Schillinger’s 
        aims is to uncover and classify “all of the available resources of our 
        tonal system”. The use of mathematics allows the task to be practical 
        since it is of a great enough scope, unlike any other methodologies.
